In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick unveiled the double-helix model of DNA, revolutionizing our understanding of inheritance. This groundbreaking discovery built upon earlier research, such as Frederick Griffith's experiments in 1928, which demonstrated that bacteria could transfer genetic material. Interestingly, as early as 1869, Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher isolated DNA (then called nuclein), although its significance remained unclear at the time. It wasn’t until 1944 that the work of Oswald Avery and his team confirmed that DNA, not proteins, is the carrier of genetic information. Fast-forwarding to the 21st century, in 2002, the Human Genome Project was completed, fulfilling the dream of mapping the entirety of human DNA—a vision that began decades earlier when scientists first suspected that genes were encoded in nucleic acids.
